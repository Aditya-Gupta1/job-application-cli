# Job Application Tracker

Job application tracker is a CLI tool to help
professionals currently applying for jobs, by keeping
a detailed record of all the job openings they have
applied to.

## Motivation

We apply to hundreds of job openings when looking out for jobs, and often forget about
them at a later point in time. Since we forget about them, we can't actually analyze
what is going right or wrong in the entire process.

So the question is: **"Why do we even need to track them?"**

Well...for any reason!

- You may want to know from which companies you're getting interview calls from.
- Or, you may want to know where you're not able to get shortlisted.
- Or, in how many companies you've completed more than 2 rounds of interviews.
- Or, in how many HR rounds you got rejected.
- or, how many offers you have. *Though you won't forget this ;)*

And the list goes on.
