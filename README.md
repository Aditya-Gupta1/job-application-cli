# Track Job Applications (CLI)

Track Job Applications is a CLI app to help
professionals currently applying for jobs, by keeping
a detailed record of all the job openings they have
applied to and provide relevant metrics on them.

## Motivation

The question is: **"Why do we even need to track our job applications?"**

We apply to hundreds of job openings when looking out for jobs, and often forget about
them at a later point in time. Since we forget about them, we can't actually analyze
what is going right or wrong in the entire process. 

And actually there's a lot we can do with this data! It can be used to answer questions like:

- In how many companies have I been shortlisted yet?
- What companies rejected my profile?
- In how many companies have I given 2 rounds of tech interviews?
- In how many HR rounds I got rejected?
- How many offers do I have? *Though you won't forget this one :wink:*

And the list goes on.
